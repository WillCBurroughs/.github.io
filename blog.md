## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not? 

> The first week **was not what I expected**. I thought there was going to be more lectures and more HTML, CSS, and javascript the first week. I didn't expect us to go as in-depth with markdown. I also didn't expect to learn as much about git or terminal at this point. <br> </br> One thing that I did expect was for us to have meetings. The class size was about what I thought it would be since it was how many people I saw earlier in the classmates tab, but a couple of people joined since then so it was a bit more people than I expected. 

<br> </br>

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

> **I'm excited to learn more about backend and storing data**. I think it's going to be neat to actually be able to collect data and be able to use it. At that point I think I'll feel like I could make something that would have a lot of utility. I'm sure as I learn more, I'll also learn more stuff that I don't know though. 

<br> </br>

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

> I'm making a dating app and that is one of the main reasons I'm taking the bootcamp. I'm passionate about startups and I want to start a company that improves the world someday. I really enjoy creating things and I think looking back on things you have made, ***especially if they have utility and have made someone's life better is very rewarding***. <br></br> ![Image of app I'm making](/img/SmallestLogo.png)

## New Code Snippets 

> **While studying this week I have learned several new and interesting coding snippets**. I have been able to study a bit of git, some commands in terminal and of course Markdown. I think and hope all of this will come in useful in the future. If what I've learned is able to help anyone I'm glad to help share it.

# Week 2

## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

> I wish that I could create a backend from scratch to make a useful application. I also want to improve my design skills to make something that looks good 

## What are you struggling with?

> I am struggling most with design. I keep trying to find hard rules to help learn design, things like what size certain on-screen elements should be and how to make and check pages aesthetic to see what does and does not work. 

## How do you solve a problem? 

> I look back at times that I have had a previous problem, outline potential solutions and decide on what the most practical answer is. If I don't like the solution I iterate over what I've made.

## What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

> Take a break, look at similar problems. Try something that is close to solving the problem and then iterate. 


# Week 3

## What do we want to keep doing?

> Working on projects that are fun and that I can learn from. Learning everyday and having a good time making things that I enjoy. 

## What do we want to stop doing?

> Only finishing projects without doing the best I could. Always work on projects and a little extra to them. 

## What do we want to write into our DNA and do forever?

> Enjoying making projects and coming up with fun ideas for interesting projects 

## What do we want to tell our "prior to Bootcamp" self?

> Working on projects is the best way to learn and you will run into things that you don't like. Sometimes you have to go through things the longways.
